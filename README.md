# Physics Events

## Overview
I work at the University of Michigan under the Department of Physics' communication division. This is a program aimed at the automation of collection of the weekly events.

This program is built under the GNU-GPL-3.0 License and as such, any use of this source code must follow all restrictions set forth in said license. As such, this program's source code is free to use for everyone to build and recreate and/or fork, the only thing I ask in return is the continuation of open-source programs and credit for only what my source code contributed to your projects.

## Download

## Building the Application Yourself
To create the application yourself, simply clone the repository, and open physicsEvents.sln in Visual Studio 2022, from there you have the option to build a debug or release.
